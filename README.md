# Mathematical-Symbol-Recognition

inspired by https://github.com/xyjiang94/EquationRecognition

The original purpose of mathematical symbol recognition is the basis for mathematical equation&fomular recognition.

### Requirements
 * Python 3.X
 * Tensoflow-GPU
 * Numpy
 * Pandas

This Learning Algorithm involve Basic Mathematical Symbol 

### Data source

### Purpose

We often need to check the graph about problem while doing Homework
it would be a good idea to get help from computer to make the graph verification a little simpler.
There is a good place to provide mathematical convenience, like Wolframalpha. 
However, in order to enter a formula here, various special symbols need to be analyzed one by one.
This is a very annoying thing. 
But what if computer recognize mathematical symbol that Handwritten? This will be very grace and interesting.
