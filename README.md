# Mathematical-Symbol-Recognition

inspired by https://github.com/MkdmOmar/Mathematical-Symbol-Recognition

The original purpose of mathematical symbol recognition is the basis for mathematical equation&fomular recognition.

### Requirements
 * Python 3.X
 * Tensoflow-GPU
 * Numpy
 * Pandas

This Learning Algorithm involve Basic Mathematical Symbol 

### Data source
* https://www.kaggle.com/cyruseption/mathematical-symbol-recognition-using-svm

### Purpose

Generally korean Keyboard Do not have Mathematical Symbol button(=key).

 

when input mathematical symbol or equation, we have experience Uncomfortable.

 

because, we input to computer special symbol in speical way each symbol.

 

if Handwritten Recognition Exsist, we more simply approach this topic
